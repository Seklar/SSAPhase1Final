    <string name="about_string_text">In the modern world there are times where we donâ€™t feel safe. 
        You maybe in an unknown area, traveling on your own or at home.
         This app is designed to connect you with family and friends in real time,
          allowing them to track your movements but also allowing you to make them aware of just how safe,
           or unsafe, you feel.
